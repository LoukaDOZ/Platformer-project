# Platformer-project

Unity plateformer game prototype made while following the Digital Games and Interactions course at ENSIIE in partnership with Télécom SudParis during our 3rd year of engineering school.
It is also the base for a custom controller made with Arduino the same year.

## Game

It was an introduction to game developping in Unity and to allow playing with a controller or a keyboard. The project had a 1st part of developping a lot of plateformer mecanics (dash, jump, double jump, sprint, wall slide, wall jump, ice floor, trampoline, ...) and actions and then, a 2nd UI/UX part with visual and auditory feedbacks.

## Custom controller

The controller includes :
- an accelerometer MPU-6050
- a tone générator
- a button
- a potentiometer
- a 4x7 segments display
